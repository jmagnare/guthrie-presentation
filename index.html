          <q>I took a bath this morning in six war speeches, and a sprinkle of peace. Looks like ever body is declaring war against the forces of force. That's what you get for building up a big war machine. It scares your neighbors into jumping on you, and then of course they them selves have to use force, so you are against their force, and they're aginst yours. Look like the ring has been drawed and the marbles are all in. The millionaires has throwed their silk hats and our last set of drawers in the ring. The fuse is lit and the cannon  is set, and somebody is in for a frailin. I would like to see every single soldier on every single side, just take off your helmet, unbuckle your kit, lay down your rifle, and set down at the side of some shady lane, and say, nope, I aint a gonna kill nobody. Plenty of rich folks wants to fight. Give them the guns.</q>

          <h2>My Take</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Quote is sensible</li>
            <li>Military buildup as much a temptation as a deterrent</li>
            <li>Those who want the war should fight it</li>
            <li>If you can't get enough volunteers to wage war, you shouldn't be waging it</li>
